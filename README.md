Write AI agent skills once. Sync to 25 clients. Manage across multiple repos.

AllAgents keeps your AI tooling (skills, agents, hooks, MCP servers) in one workspace and syncs it to every client your team uses — Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, and 20 more.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create a workspace from a shared template
npx allagents init my-workspace --from myorg/templates/nodejs
cd my-workspace

# Install plugins
npx allagents plugin install code-review@claude-plugins-official

# Sync to all configured clients
npx allagents update
```

No cloning required — AllAgents fetches the `workspace.yaml` directly from GitHub and sets up everything.

## How It Works

1. **Configure** your workspace with repos, plugins, and target clients in `workspace.yaml`
2. **Sync** — AllAgents copies skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers to each client's expected paths
3. **Work** — every team member gets identical AI tooling via git, across any client they choose

## Why AllAgents?

Tools like `npx skills` and `npx plugins` install skills to one project for one or two clients. AllAgents manages your entire AI tooling stack — skills, agents, hooks, commands, and MCP servers — across multiple repos and all your clients, from a single declarative config.

| | `npx skills` | `npx plugins` | `npx allagents` |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Config** | Imperative | Imperative | Declarative (`workspace.yaml`) |
| **Scope** | Single project | Single project | Multi-repo workspace |
| **Artifacts** | Skills | Skills, agents, hooks, commands, MCP | Skills, agents, hooks, commands, MCP |
| **Clients** | 43 agents | 2 (Claude, Cursor) | 25 clients simultaneously |
| **Team sharing** | Each dev runs install | Each dev runs install | Git-versioned — clone and go |
| **Ongoing sync** | One-shot install | One-shot install | `allagents update` keeps everything current |
| **Workspace awareness** | None | None | WORKSPACE-RULES injected so AI knows all repos and skills |
| **Provider resilience** | Per-client | Per-client | Switch clients instantly — same tooling everywhere |

## Supported Clients

**25 AI coding assistants** across two tiers:

**Universal** (share `.agents/skills/`): Copilot, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini, Amp Code, VSCode, Replit, Kimi

**Provider-specific**: Claude, Pi, OMP, Cursor, Factory, OpenClaw, Windsurf, Cline, Continue, Roo, Kilo, Trae, Augment, Zencoder, Junie, OpenHands, Kiro

See the [client support matrix](https://allagents.dev/docs/reference/clients/) for paths, hooks, commands, and MCP support per client.

## Plugin Structure

```
my-plugin/
├── skills/          # Reusable prompts (all clients)
│   └── debugging/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── agents/          # Agent definitions
├── commands/        # Slash commands (Claude, OpenCode)
├── hooks/           # Lifecycle hooks (Claude, Factory, Copilot, Codex)
├── .codex-plugin/   # Codex plugin manifest and explicit hook paths
├── .github/         # Copilot/VSCode project overrides
└── .mcp.json        # MCP server configs
```

For Codex project sync, AllAgents copies skills into `.codex/skills/`, merges
plugin hooks into `.codex/hooks.json`, and preserves user-owned hooks already in
that file. Codex plugins can declare hooks in `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` with a
`hooks` path, path array, inline object, or inline object array; otherwise
AllAgents falls back to `hooks/hooks.json`.

For Copilot project sync, AllAgents combines plugin hook declarations from
`hooks.json` or `hooks/hooks.json` in `.github/hooks/allagents.json` and binds
`COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT` for each plugin. Other repository hooks under
`.github/hooks/` remain project-scoped and are never promoted into the
user-global `~/.copilot/hooks/` directory. Copilot package metadata under
`.github/plugin/` is not copied into the project overlay. Potential user-scope
copies from older versions are left untouched and reported for manual review
because their ownership was not tracked.

Marketplace registration and `plugin.json` are not required for direct plugin
sources. A plugin without a supported hook declaration continues syncing its
other artifacts. AllAgents warns and omits a declaration that cannot be read or
parsed as JSON or lacks the version-1 `hooks` object envelope. A declaration
with `disableAllHooks: true` adds no entries; otherwise, a non-array event value
also omits the declaration. Skipping a declaration does not reject the plugin
or itself suppress other eligible artifacts, including repository hook files.
